# Paris Transit Database Design

This project demonstrates a **complete relational database design process** for a public transport management scenario.  
It showcases my ability to design, normalize, and implement a relational database schema from business requirements.

---

## Objectives
- Translate real-world business requirements into a **conceptual data model (ERD)**.
- Apply **normalization rules** (UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
- Develop a **logical schema** in 3NF with primary and foreign keys.
- Implement the schema in **Oracle SQL** with constraints.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Conceptual Model (ERD)**  
   - Designed using crow’s foot notation.  
   - Captures key entities (e.g., transit officials, vehicles, trips, drivers, routes).  
   - See: [`ERD_Conceptual.png`](./ERD_Conceptual.png)

2. **Logical Model (3NF)**  
   - Normalized relational tables with enforced referential integrity.  
   - See: [`Logical_Model_3NF.png`](./Logical_Model_3NF.png)

3. **Oracle SQL Schema**  
   - [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql) includes:
     - `CREATE TABLE` statements
     - Primary/Foreign key constraints
     - Column definitions with appropriate data types

4. **Key Assumptions**  
   - Documented business assumptions to clarify design decisions.  
   - See: [`assumptions.md`](./assumptions.md)

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Modeling**: Identified entities, attributes, and relationships.  
- **Database Normalization**: Achieved 3NF to improve efficiency and consistency.  
- **SQL DDL**: Created tables, primary/foreign keys, and constraints in Oracle SQL.  
- **Analytical Thinking**: Translated complex business rules into a structured relational schema.

This project highlights my capability to **design scalable, normalized relational databases** that can support analytical queries and operational systems.
